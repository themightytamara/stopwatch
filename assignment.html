Overview

Build a Stopwatch component that: 

Allows the user to press a button "Start" to start the stopwatch
While the stopwatch is started, the incrementing time should be displayed
Allows the user to press a button "Pause" to pause the stopwatch at the current time
Re-clicking the "Pause" button should resume the stopwatch
Allows the user to press a button "Reset" to stop the stopwatch and reset the time to 0
 

Here is an example (Links to an external site.)! 

It is meant to be used as guideline. It can be designed anyway you like as long as the requirements are met!

Plagiarism includes but is not limited to copying code from another student’s work and/or another existing website. You are allowed to use small pieces of non-original code, provided you properly provide citations and can explain the code’s functionality to your instructor.

You cannot rely on someone else’s entire program with only having changed the variable names, and including the citation as well.
